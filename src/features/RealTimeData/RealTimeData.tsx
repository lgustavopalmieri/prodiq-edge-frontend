// oee, performance, quality, availability
// machine status
// good, defected quantity (in prod info we sum both to have the total)
// ideal estimated time to finish that order based on standard cycletime
// alerts

// estimated time just enables and works when an order is started
// alert always be enabled
// when a order is running:
    // our setup form became a new disabled session
    // it will be enabled when we finish the order
    // bellow we should have an disabled finish order button 
    // the button became enabled if the machine is stopped
    // if the button is clicked we enable the rest of the session
    // it should contain good/ bad quantities to manually declare the finals
    // we can also have an stops justification
